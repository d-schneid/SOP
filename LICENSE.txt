Our program uses the Python pyod library.
As we have special requirements for the algorithms to be used in our program,
we copy the algorithm files form the pyod library into a special folder for later
use by our program. In the process, the code is changed to suit our needs.
This includes e.g. changing the class name and imports.
We also use some pyod-algorithms for testing purposes.
